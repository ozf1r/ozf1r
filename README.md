Hi there, I’m @ozf1r

I’m interested in electronics, the Arduino, digital audio synthesis and anything to do with 
randomness and blinking lights.

You can contact me best at [t.me/ozf1r](https://t.me/ozf1r) or via ancient email method Late@Linuxrauta.fi

My biggest achievement is the Binary Modulation Synthesizer for Arduino. Was uploaded originally with my old profile. [Check it out...](https://github.com/ozf1r/binaraymodulationsynth).
